Websockets-Networked-Chat
=========================
Python and tornado websocket chatroom.

To use this, you must have tornado installed. If you have pip, you can run "pip install tornado" or you can view installation instructions on their site here (http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/#installation)

You will need a front end to test this.
